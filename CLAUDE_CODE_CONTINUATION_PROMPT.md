# Claude Code Continuation Prompt
**For new Claude Code session to continue i10iQ.AI development**

## Session Context
Copy and paste this entire prompt into a new Claude Code session to continue where we left off.

---

**IMPORTANT CONTEXT**: This is a continuation of web development work on the i10iQ.AI website. I need you to help me debug a contact form issue on my fully deployed website.

## Current Project Status

### ✅ WHAT'S WORKING
- **Live Website**: https://i10iq.ai (fully deployed with custom domain)
- **Backend API**: https://i10iq-ai-production.up.railway.app (healthy)
- **All UI/UX**: Complete with blurple theme (#5c4bea), responsive design
- **Infrastructure**: Vercel + Railway + MongoDB Atlas all configured

### ⚠️ CURRENT PROBLEM
**Contact form submissions return "Something went wrong. Please try again."**
- Backend returns 500 Internal Server Error on POST to `/api/contact`
- Health endpoint `/api/health` works fine
- Environment variables are configured in Railway
- MongoDB Atlas cluster is set up and accessible

## Technical Environment

### Working Directory
```
/Users/aaronuitenbroek/projects/i10iq-deployment/I10iQ-ai/
```

### Key Files
- **Frontend**: `frontend/src/components/ContactForm.js` 
- **Backend**: `backend/server.py`
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas cluster `i10iq-production`

### Service URLs
- **Frontend**: https://i10iq.ai
- **Backend**: https://i10iq-ai-production.up.railway.app
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/auitenbroek1/I10iQ-ai

### Account Setup Complete
- ✅ Vercel (connected to GitHub)
- ✅ Railway Hobby plan ($5/month)
- ✅ MongoDB Atlas free tier
- ✅ GoDaddy DNS configured

## Recent Changes Made
1. **Fixed backend logger configuration** (moved to top of file)
2. **Added phone field** to ContactFormCreate and ContactFormSubmission models
3. **Updated service dropdown** options to match main site
4. **Configured Railway environment variables**: MONGO_URL, DB_NAME, CORS_ORIGINS
5. **Added test endpoint** `/api/test-contact` for debugging

## Contact Form Issue Details

### Error Behavior
- User fills out contact form in "Learn More" modal
- Clicks "Send" button
- Gets "Something went wrong. Please try again." message
- Browser network tab shows 500 Internal Server Error

### What We've Tried
- ✅ Fixed logger configuration in backend
- ✅ Added phone field to backend models
- ✅ Set Railway environment variables
- ✅ Added "Add All" shared variables to service
- ✅ Verified CORS configuration
- ✅ Tested health endpoint (works)

### Railway Environment Variables Set
```
MONGO_URL=mongodb+srv://auitenbroek:Mongoizda14me!@i10iq-production.sr0fuli.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=i10iq-production
DB_NAME=i10iq_production  
CORS_ORIGINS=https://i10iq.ai,https://www.i10iq.ai
```

### Test Commands That Show the Issue
```bash
# This works (200 OK)
curl https://i10iq-ai-production.up.railway.app/api/health

# This fails (500 Error)
curl -X POST https://i10iq-ai-production.up.railway.app/api/contact \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Test","email":"test@test.com","phone":"555-1234","company":"Test","message":"Test message","service_interest":"ai-level-up"}'
```

## What I Need Help With

**PRIMARY GOAL**: Fix the contact form 500 errors so form submissions save to MongoDB Atlas.

**SUSPECTED ISSUES**:
1. MongoDB connection problem despite environment variables being set
2. Railway deployment not picking up environment variables correctly
3. Database permissions or network access issue
4. Pydantic model validation errors

**DEBUGGING APPROACH NEEDED**:
1. Check Railway deployment logs for specific error messages
2. Test MongoDB connection directly from Railway environment  
3. Verify the test endpoint `/api/test-contact` works (bypasses database)
4. Check MongoDB Atlas logs for connection attempts
5. Simplify contact endpoint to isolate the issue

## Project File Structure
```
I10iQ-ai/
├── frontend/src/components/ContactForm.js    # Frontend form
├── backend/server.py                         # FastAPI backend
├── STABLE_BACKUP_v2.2_custom-domain-deployed/  # Current backup
├── DEPLOYMENT_STATUS_v2.2.md               # Detailed status
└── RESTORE_STABLE_BACKUP_v2.2.sh           # Restore script
```

## Available Backups
- **Current stable**: v2.2.0-custom-domain-deployed
- **Git tags**: v2.0.0-blurple-final, v2.1.0-enhanced-interactions
- **Restore command**: `./RESTORE_STABLE_BACKUP_v2.2.sh`

## My Working Style Preferences
- **Concise responses** - I prefer direct solutions over explanations
- **Show URLs** after deployments so I can test immediately  
- **Use TodoWrite** to track debugging steps
- **Test thoroughly** before declaring fixes complete

## First Steps Requested
1. **Navigate to the working directory**: `/Users/aaronuitenbroek/projects/i10iq-deployment/I10iQ-ai/`
2. **Test the current API endpoints** to confirm the issue
3. **Check Railway logs** or deployment status for specific error messages
4. **Debug the MongoDB connection** issue systematically
5. **Fix the contact form** so it successfully saves to the database

---

**Ready to continue!** Please start by testing the current contact form endpoint and then systematically debug the 500 error issue. The website is otherwise fully deployed and working perfectly.
